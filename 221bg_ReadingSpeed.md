The reading speed of second grade students is approximately normal, with a mean of 90 words per minute (wpm) and a standard deviation of 10 wpm (Sullivan, pp. 439). What is the probability a randomly selected student will read more than 95 words per minute?

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

$\mu = 90$

$\sigma = 10$

$x = 95$

$z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{95 - 90}{10} = 0.5$

Normal Probability Information

To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

Shade the side of interest.

Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).

Read the probability from the area box.



=1-NORM.S.DIST(0.5,TRUE)

$P(X>95) = P(Z>0.5) = 0.3085$

The probability a randomly selected student will read faster than 95 words per minute is 0.309.
