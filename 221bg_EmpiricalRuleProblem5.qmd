---

Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area between $z = 2$ and $z = 3$. Remember to draw pictures.

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

The area we are interested in is shown below.

![](fig_approx_2to3.png)

The area within 3 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.997.

![](fig_approx_3stdev.png)

The area within 2 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.95.

If we remove (subtract) the area between $z = -2$ and $z=2$ from the area between $z = -3$ and $z=3$, we will be left with the areas between $z=-3$ and $z=-2$ and between $z=2$ and $z=3$.

![](fig_approx_2to3_equation.png)

0.997 - 0.95 = 0.047

Because the distribution is symmetric these two remaining areas will be the same size.

0.047/2 = 0.0235

The area between $z = 2$ and $z = 3$ is 0.0235 (or 2.35% of the total area).
