---

-   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area from $z = -1$ to $z=0$. *Remember the normal distribution is symmetric.*

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    The area within 1 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.68.

    The distribution is symmetric so the area from $z=0$ to $z=1$ will be half of 0.68.

    0.68/2 = 0.34

    The area from $z = -1$ to $z=0$ will be approximately 0.34 (or 34% of the total area).

    -   *What does that tell you about the area from* $z = 0$ *to* $z=1$*?*

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area from $z = -1$ to $z = 0$ (or 34% of the total area).

-   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate below $z=-1$.

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    The area within 1 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.68.

    The total area is 1, so the area in both tails combine will be 1-0.68 = 0.32.

    Since the distribution is symmetric, the area in the left tail will be half of that, 0.32/2 = 0.16.

    The area below $z = -1$ will be approximately 0.16 (or 16% of the total area).

    -   *What does that tell you about the area above* $z = 1$*?*

        Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area below $z = -1$ (or 16% of the total area).
