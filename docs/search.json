This is because calculating the median requires that we compare the number 6 (or the corrected number 60) to every value in the data set when we order them. So we have to know the other values to know how the median is effected when we change the 6 to a 60.\nUsing this observation we see that don’t know how the median will change when we change the one score from 6 to a 60 in the 100 grades.\nWe would have to know the rest of the 100 grades to know how the median would change."

Because 6 increased to 60 this caused the mean to increase.\nUsing this observation we see that changing the one score from 6 to 60 in the data set of 100 grades will also cause the mean to increase.\n\nWould changing the score from 6 to 60 cause the median of the 100 grades to increase, decrease or stay the same?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\nWe saw with the toy data sets ({6, 58,100} and {6, 87, 100}) that changing the 6 to a 60 had a different effect on the median in each data set. This is because calculating the median requires that we compare the number 6 (or the corrected number 60) to every value in the data set when we order them. So we have to know the other values to know how the median is effected when we change the 6 to a 60.\nUsing this observation we see that don’t know how the median will change when we change the one score from 6 to a 60 in the 100 grades.\nWe would have to know the rest of the 100 grades to know how the median would change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem Set 2\n\n\nUse the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area from \\(z = -1\\) to \\(z=0\\).

Because 6 increased to 60 this caused the mean to increase.\nUsing this observation we see that changing the one score from 6 to 60 in the data set of 100 grades will also cause the mean to increase.\n\nWould changing the score from 6 to 60 cause the median of the 100 grades to increase, decrease or stay the same?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\nWe saw with the toy data sets ({6, 58,100} and {6, 87, 100}) that changing the 6 to a 60 had a different effect on the median in each data set. This is because calculating the median requires that we compare the number 6 (or the corrected number 60) to every value in the data set when we order them. So we have to know the other values to know how the median is effected when we change the 6 to a 60.\nUsing this observation we see that don’t know how the median will change when we change the one score from 6 to a 60 in the 100 grades.\nWe would have to know the rest of the 100 grades to know how the median would change.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might help students make the distinction between percentiles from a distribution verses sample percentiles if several problem sets include percentile"

What is the probability that more than 38% of those in such a survey would have received a phishing email?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\n\\(p = 0.43\\)\n\\(n = 400\\)\n\\(\\hat{p} = 0.38\\)\n\\(z = \\frac{\\hat{p}-p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \\frac{0.38-0.43}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.43(1-0.43)}{400}}} = -2.01989\\)\nNormal Probability Applet Information\nTo find the probability corresponding to a \\(z\\)-score.\n\nShade the side of interest.\nType the \\(z\\)-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).\nRead the probability from the area box. \n\n\n\\(P(\\hat{P} &gt; 0.38) = P(Z &gt; -2.01989) = 0.9783\\)\n=1-NORM.DIST(0.38,0.43,SQRT(0.43*(1-0.43)/400),TRUE)\nThe probability that more than 38% of respondents in such a survey would have received a phishing email is 0.978.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem: Stock Market\nYou take a simple random sample of 200 adults from a town in the Western United States to determine the proportion of those in town who invest in the stock market. Assume the unknown population proportion or percentage of people in town who invest in the stock market is (or 30%). What is the probability that more than 25% of those in such a survey would have invested in the stock market?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\n\\(p = 0.3\\)\n\\(n = 200\\)\n\\(\\hat{p} = 0.25\\)\n\\(z = \\frac{\\hat{p}-p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \\frac{0.25-0.3}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.3(0.7)}{200}}} = -1.54303\\)\nNormal Probability Applet Information\nTo find the probability corresponding to a \\(z\\)-score.\n\nShade the side of interest.\nType the \\(z\\)-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).\nRead the probability from the area box. \n\n\n\\(P(\\hat{P} &gt; 0.25) = P(Z &gt; -1.543) = 0.9386\\)\n=1-NORM.DIST(0.25,0.3,SQRT(0.3*(0.7)/200),TRUE)\nThe probability that more than 38% of respondents in such a survey would have received a phishing email is 0.978.\n\n\n\nProblem: Smoking Teens\nCalculate the probability, if possible. If it is not possible to compute the probability explain why not.\nA study was conducted to determine the proportion of American teenagers who smoke. Previous surveys showed that 15% percent of teenagers smoke. A Gallup survey interviewed a nationally representative sample of 785 teenagers. What is the probability less than 97 teenagers in the survey smoke?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\n\\(p = 0.15\\)\n\\(n = 785\\)\n\\(np = 785(0.15) = 117.75 \\geq 10\\) (check!)\n\\(n(1-p) = 785(1-0.15) = 667.25 \\geq 10\\) (check!)\n\\(x = 97\\)\n\\(\\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{n} = \\frac{97}{785} = 0.123567\\)\n\\(z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \\frac{\\frac{97}{785} - 0.15}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.15(1-0.15)}{785}}} = -2.07409\\)\n=((97/785) - 0.15)/SQRT(0.15*(1-0.15)/785)\nNormal Probability Applet Information\nTo find the probability corresponding to a \\(z\\)-score.\n\nShade the side of interest.\nType the \\(z\\)-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).\nRead the probability from the area box.\n\n\n\\(P(X &lt; 97) = P(\\hat{P} &lt; 0.124) = P(Z &lt; -2.074) = 0.0190\\)\n=NORM.DIST(97/785, 0.15, SQRT(0.15*(1-0.15)/785), TRUE)\nThe probability less than 97 teenagers in the survey smoke is 0.019.\n\n\n\nProblem: COVID\nCalculate the probability, if possible. If it is not possible to compute the probability explain why not.\nData from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that among the people in the United States who are fully vaccinated, the probability of getting COVID is very, very small: only 0.0001. Suppose you plan to survey 50,000 people (\\(n=50000\\)) who are fully vaccinated to see if they contracted COVID after getting the vaccine. What is the probability that less than 10 of the fully vaccinated people you survey contracted COVID after getting the vaccine?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\n\\(p = 0.0001\\)\n\\(n = 50000\\)\n\\(np = 50000(0.0001) = 5 \\ngeq 10\\)\nSince \\(np \\neq 10\\) we see \\(\\hat{P}\\) is not normally distributed. So we cannot calculate this probability!"
