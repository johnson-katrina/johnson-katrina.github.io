The probability of snow cannot be 1.2 because \\(1.2 \\nleq 1\\) (rather 1.2 &gt; 1).\n\n\nProblem: Snow in May\nSuppose the probability of snow in Rexburg in May is 0.79. What is the probability that there will be no snow in Rexburg in May?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\n1-0.79 = 0.21\nThe probability that there will be no snow in Rexburg in May is 0.21.\n\n\nProblem: Tokens\nA box of tokens contains 8 blue tokens, 6 red tokens, and 4 yellow tokens.\n\nIf a token is selected at random from the box, what is the probability that the token is blue?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\nP( token is blue ) = \\(\\frac{8}{8+6+4} = \\frac{8}{18} = \\frac{4}{9} = 0.\\overline{4}\\)\n\nIf a token is selected at random from the box, what is the probability that the token is not red?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\nP( token is red ) = \\(\\frac{6}{18} = 0.\\overline{3}\\)\nP( token is NOT red ) = \\(1 - 0.\\overline{3} = 0.\\overline{6}\\)\n\n\n\nProblem: Blood Type\nThe probability that a randomly chosen North American has a particular ABO blood type and Rh factor is given below.\nSource: “The Analysis of Biological Data” by Whitlock and Schluter, 3rd Edition, page 125.\n\n\n\nBlood Type\nProbability\n\n\n\n\nO+\n0.374\n\n\nO-\n0.066\n\n\nA+\n0.357\n\n\nA-\n0.063\n\n\nB+\n0.085\n\n\nB-\n0.015\n\n\nAB+\n0.034\n\n\nAB-\n0.006\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected North American, will have blood type A?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\nP( has type A+ ) + P( has type A- ) = 0.357 + 0.063 = 0.42\nThe probability that randomly selected North American will have type A blood is 0.42.\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected North American, will ’‘’not’’’ have O+ blood type?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\n1 - P( has type 0+) = 1 - 0.374 = 0.626\nThe probability that a randomly selected North American will not have O+ blood is 0.626.\n\n\n\nProblem: 3 Coin Flips\nIf you flip a fair coin 3 times you could get either 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads with the following probabilities.\n\n\n\n0 Heads\n1 Head\n2 Heads\n3 Heads\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n??\n\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that you will get 1 head in the three tosses?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\nP( 1 head ) = 1 - P( not 1 head) = 1 - (1/8 + 3/8 + 1/8) = 1 - 5/8 = 3/8\n\nWhat is the probability you will not get (exactly) 2 heads in the three tosses?\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\n1 - P( 2 heads ) = 1 - 3/8 = 5/8"
