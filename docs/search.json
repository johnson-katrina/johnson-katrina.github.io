Find the 80th percentile.\n\n\n\n\nPossible Solution\n\n\\(\\mu =266\\)\n\\(\\sigma = 16\\)\nNormal Probability Applet Information\nTo find the z-score corresponding to the 80th percentile.\n\nSelect all the area to the left.\nType 0.8 in the Area box.\nRead the z-score from the right box.\n\n\nWith 80% of the area to the left, the z-score is 0.842.\n\\(z = 0.842\\)\n\\(\\begin{aligned} x &= \\mu + z\\sigma \\\\ &= 266 + 0.842(16) \\\\ &= 279.472 \\end{aligned}\\)\nThe 80th percentile is 279.5 days (\\(x = 279.5\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2:\n\n\nThe Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is required for admission to many law schools. The scores on the LSAT are approximately normal with mean of 150 and standard deviation of 9. Queen’s School of Business in Kingston, Ontario requires a minimum LSAT score of 157 for admission. What is the probability that a randomly selected student will score below 157?  \n\n\nPossible Solution\n\n$= 150 $\n$= 9 $\n\\(x = 157\\)\n\\(z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{157 - 150}{9} = 0.\\overline{7}\\)\n\\(P(X &lt; 157) = P(Z &lt; 0.\\overline{7}) = 0.7817\\)\nNormal Probability Applet Information\nTo find the probability corresponding to a z-score. 1. Shade the side of interest. 2. Type the z-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box). 3. Read the probability from the area box.\n\n=NORM.DIST(157,150,9,TRUE)"
