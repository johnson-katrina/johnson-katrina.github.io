A box of tokens contains 8 blue tokens, 6 red tokens, and 4 yellow tokens.

If a token is selected at random from the box, what is the probability that the token is blue?

P( token is blue ) = $\frac{8}{8+6+4} = \frac{8}{18} = \frac{4}{9} = 0.\overline{4}$

If a token is selected at random from the box, what is the probability that the token is not red?

<details>

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

P( token is red ) = $\frac{6}{18} = 0.\overline{3}$

P( token is NOT red ) = $1 - 0.\overline{3} = 0.\overline{6}$
