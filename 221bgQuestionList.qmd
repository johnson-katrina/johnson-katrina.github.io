This list of problems focus on computations and concepts that students have a tendency of mixing up or need additional practice. These problems are intended the to be used as interleaved retrievel practice at the beginning of class to keep the concepts fresh in students minds throughout the semester.

As the problems are selected the box can be checked and a note can indicate which week/day it was used. It is probably okay to use problems more than once as long as there is some time between uses.

-   [ ] **Problem:** Reading Speed

    The reading speed of second grade students is approximately normal, with a mean of 90 words per minute (wpm) and a standard deviation of 10 wpm (Sullivan, pp. 439). What is the probability a randomly selected student will read more than 95 words per minute?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $\mu = 90$

    $\sigma = 10$

    $x = 95$

    $z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{95 - 90}{10} = 0.5$

    **Normal Probability Information**

    To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

    1.  Shade the side of interest.
    2.  Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
    3.  Read the probability from the area box.

    ![](fig_ReadingSpeed.png)

    ``` excel
    =1-NORM.S.DIST(0.5,TRUE)
    ```

    $P(X>95) = P(Z>0.5) = 0.3085$

    The probability a randomly selected student will read faster than 95 words per minute is 0.309.

    Suppose the mean GPA of BYU-Idaho students is 3.5 and the standard deviation is 0.7. It is well known that this distribution is left-skewed. What is the probability that a random sample of 70 students will have a mean GPA less than 3.6?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $\mu = 3.5$

    $\sigma = 0.7$

    $n = 70$

    $\overline{x} = 3.6$

    $z = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{3.6 - 3.5}{\frac{0.7}{\sqrt{70}}} = 1.19523$

    **Normal Probability Applet Information**

    To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

    1.  Shade the side of interest.
    2.  Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
    3.  Read the probability from the area box.

    ![](fig_GPA.png)

    $P(\overline{X} < 3.6) = P(Z<1.195) = 0.8840$

    ``` excel
    =NORM.DIST(3.6, 3.5, 0.7/SQRT(70), TRUE)
    ```

    The probability a randomly selected sample of 70 students will have a mean GPA less than 3.6 is 0.884.

    Suppose the mean GPA of BYU-Idaho students is 3.5 and the standard deviation is 0.7. It is well known that this distribution is left-skewed. What is the probability that a random sample of 17 students will have a mean GPA less than 3.2?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    We know $\overline{X}$ is not normally distributed since $n=17$ and the population (of GPAs) is left-skewed. So we **cannot** calculate this probability!

-   [ ] **Problem:** Reading Speed (Take 2)

    Calculate the probability, if possible. If it is not possible to compute the probability explain why not.

    The reading speed of second grade students is approximately normal, with a mean of 90 words per minute (wpm) and a standard deviation of 10 wpm (Sullivan, pp. 439). What is the probability that a random sample of 3 second grade students will have a mean reading rate less than 93 words per minute?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $\mu = 90$

    $\sigma = 10$

    $n = 3$

    $\overline{x} = 93$

    $z = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{93-90}{\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}} = 0.519615$

    **Normal Probability Applet Information**

    To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

    1.  Shade the side of interest.
    2.  Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
    3.  Read the probability from the area box.

    ![](fig_ReadingSpeed2.png)

    $P(\overline{X} <93) = P(Z < 0.52) = 0.6985$

    ``` excel
    =NORM.DIST(93, 90, 10/SQRT(3), TRUE)

-   [ ] **Problem:** PH Probability and Hypothesis Test

    In a manufacturing facility, the pH of a solution must be carefully monitored. Historically, the pH values have been normally distributed with mean 3.25 and standard deviation 0.08. Find the probability that on the next test the pH of the solution will be less than 3.32.

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $\mu = 3.25$

    $\sigma = 0.08$

    $x = 3.32$

    $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{3.32 - 3.25}{0.08} = 0.875$

    ![](fig_PH.png)

    $P(X < 3.32) = P(Z < 0.875) = 0.8092$

    The probability that on the next test the pH will be less than 3.32 is 0.809.

    In a manufacturing facility, the pH of a solution must be carefully monitored. Historically, the pH values have been normally distributed with mean 3.25 and standard deviation 0.08. The quality control department wants to test whether the true mean pH is less than 3.25. They will use the next sample to complete this test. The next sample has a pH of 3.32.

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    **Null and alternative hypotheses**

    $H_0: \mu = 3.25$

    $H_a: \mu < 3.25$

    **Level of significance**

    $\alpha = 0.05$

    **Summary statistics**

    $x = 3.32$

    Assume $\sigma = 0.08$

    **Test statistic**$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{3.32-3.25}{0.08} = 0.875$

    *Note: This is the same as* $z = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{3.32 - 3.25}{\frac{0.08}{\sqrt{1}}} = 0.875$*.*

    **P-value and comparison to** $\alpha$

    Because the alternative hypothesis is $\mu < 3.25$ we are looking for the probability of being less than the test statistic.

    **Normal Probability Applet Information**

    To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

    1.  Shade the side of interest.
    2.  Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
    3.  Read the probability from the area box. 

    ![](fig_PH.png)

    $P(X < 3.32) = P(Z < 0.875) = 0.8092$

    $p$-value = 0.809 \> 0.05 = $\alpha$

    **Conclusion**

    We [fail to reject]{.underline} the null hypothesis.

    **English Sentence**

    There is [insufficient]{.underline} evidence to suggest that the mean pH is less than 3.25.

## Sample Size Calculations

-   [ ] **Problem:** Blinks

    Suppose you are scientist and you want to use a confidence interval to estimate the true mean number of times a person in your city blinks each day. Find the sample size required to construct a 90% confidence interval with a margin of error 43 blinks for the true mean number of time a person blinks each day. Assume the standard deviation of blinks per day is 1240.

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $z^* = 1.645$ (because we want a confidence level of 90%)

    $m = 43$

    $\sigma = 1240$

    $n = \left(\frac{z^* \sigma}{m}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{(1.645)(1240)}{1240}\right)^2 = 2250.29$

    $n = 400$

    $\hat{p} = 0.38$

    $z = \frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \frac{0.38-0.43}{\sqrt{\frac{0.43(1-0.43)}{400}}} = -2.01989$

-   [ ] **Problem:** Smoking Teens

    Calculate the probability, if possible. If it is not possible to compute the probability explain why not.

    A study was conducted to determine the proportion of American teenagers who smoke. Previous surveys showed that 15% percent of teenagers smoke. A Gallup survey interviewed a nationally representative sample of 785 teenagers. What is the probability less than 97 teenagers in the survey smoke?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.15$

    $n = 785$

    $np = 785(0.15) = 117.75 \geq 10$ (check!)

    $n(1-p) = 785(1-0.15) = 667.25 \geq 10$ (check!)

    $x = 97$

-   [ ] **Problem:** COVID

    Calculate the probability, if possible. If it is not possible to compute the probability explain why not.

    Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that among the people in the United States who are fully vaccinated, the probability of getting COVID is very, very small: only 0.0001. Suppose you plan to survey 50,000 people ($n=50000$) who are fully vaccinated to see if they contracted COVID after getting the vaccine. What is the probability that less than 10 of the fully vaccinated people you survey contracted COVID after getting the vaccine?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.0001$

    $n = 50000$

    $np = 50000(0.0001) = 5 \ngeq 10$

    Since $np \neq 10$ we see $\hat{P}$ is not normally distributed. So we **cannot** calculate this probability!

## Sample Size

-   [ ] **Problem:** Generic Sampling Distribution Check

    Given the true proportion is $p = 0.1$. What is the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the requirements for the random variable $\hat{p}$ to be normally distributed?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.1$

    $\begin{align*}np &\geq 10 \\n(0.1) &\geq 10 \\n &\geq \frac{10}{0.1} = 100 \\n &\geq 100\end{align*}$

    $\begin{align*} n(1-p) &\geq 10 \\ n(0.9) &\geq 10 \\ n &\geq \frac{10}{0.9} = 11.\overline{1} \\ n &\geq 11.\overline{1} \end{align*}$

    Since both $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are greater than 10 when $n \geq 100$, we see that the smallest value of $n$ so that $\hat{P}$ is normally distributed is $n=100$.
