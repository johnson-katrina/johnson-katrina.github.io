This list of problems focus on computations and concepts that students have a tendency of mixing up or need additional practice. These problems are intended the to be used as interleaved retrievel practice at the beginning of class to keep the concepts fresh in students minds throughout the semester.

As the problems are selected the box can be checked and a note can indicate which week/day it was used. It is probably okay to use problems more than once as long as there is some time between uses.

    -   Consider the following data set 6, 58, 100.

        -   Calculate the mean.

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            $\overline{x} = \frac{6 + 58 + 100}{3} = 54.\overline{6}$

        -   Calculate the median.

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            The data set in order is 6, 58, 100. We see the middle value is 58.

            The median of the data is 58.

            </details>

        -   Suppose the 6 was a typo and was actually supposed to be a 60.

            -   What is the mean of the corrected data? Did the mean increase, decrease, or stay the same when **one** number in the data changed?

                <details>

                <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

                $\overline{x} = \frac{60 + 58 + 100}{3} = 72.\overline{6}$

                The mean of the corrected data is $72.\overline{6}$.

                $72.\overline{6} > 54.\overline{6}$

                The mean increased.

                </details>

                $\overline{x} = \frac{60 + 87 + 100}{3} = 82.\overline{3}$

                The mean of the corrected data is $82.\overline{3}$.

                $82.\overline{3} > 64.\overline{3}$

                The mean increased.

                </details>

            -   What is the median of the correct data? Did the median increase, decrease, or stay the same when **one** number in the data changed?

                <details>

                <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

                The corrected data set in order is 60, 87, 100. We see the middle value is 87. The median of the corrected data is 87.

                87 = 87

                The median stayed the same.

                </details>

    -   Suppose you have a set of 100 exam grades and the teacher noticed that the a student's grade recorded as a 6 was actually supposed to be a 60.

        -   Would changing the score from 6 to 60 cause the mean of the 100 grades to increase, decrease or stay the same?

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            We saw with the toy data sets ({6, 58,100} and {6, 87, 100}) that changing the 6 to a 60 caused the mean to increase. Because 6 increased to 60 this caused the mean to increase.

            Using this observation we see that changing the **one** score from 6 to 60 in the data set of 100 grades will also cause the mean to increase.

            </details>

        -   Would changing the score from 6 to 60 cause the median of the 100 grades to increase, decrease or stay the same?

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            We saw with the toy data sets ({6, 58,100} and {6, 87, 100}) that changing the 6 to a 60 had a different effect on the median in each data set. This is because calculating the median requires that we compare the number 6 (or the corrected number 60) to every value in the data set when we order them. So we have to know the other values to know how the median is effected when we change the 6 to a 60.

            Using this observation we see that don't know how the median will change when we change the **one** score from 6 to a 60 in the 100 grades.

            We would have to know the rest of the 100 grades to know how the median would change.

# After Lesson 5

## Approximate Rule for Bell Shaped Distributions

Assign Problem 1-3 on the day of Lesson 5. I think the students should have enough information after the reading to help each other reason through these exercises.

-   [ ] **Problem:** 68-95-99.7 Rule Problem 1

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area from $z = -1$ to $z=0$. *Remember the normal distribution is symmetric.*

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 1 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.68.

        ![](fig_approx_1stdev.png)

        The distribution is symmetric so the area from $z=0$ to $z=1$ will be half of 0.68.

        0.68/2 = 0.34

        The area from $z = -1$ to $z=0$ will be approximately 0.34 (or 34% of the total area).

        -   *What does that tell you about the area from* $z = 0$ *to* $z=1$*?*

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area from $z = -1$ to $z = 0$ (or 34% of the total area).

            </details>

        </details>

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate below $z=-1$.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 1 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.68.

        ![](fig_approx_1stdev.png)

        The total area is 1, so the area in both tails combine will be 1-0.68 = 0.32.

        Since the distribution is symmetric, the area in the left tail will be half of that, 0.32/2 = 0.16.

        The area below $z = -1$ will be approximately 0.16 (or 16% of the total area).

        -   *What does that tell you about the area above* $z = 1$*?*

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area below $z = -1$ (or 16% of the total area).

            </details>

        </details>

-   [ ] **Problem:** 68-95-99.7 Rule Problem 2

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area from $z = -2$ to $z=0$.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 2 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.95.

        ![](fig_approx_2stdev.png)

        The distribution is symmetric so the area from $z=0$ to $z=2$ will be half of 0.95.

        0.95/2 = 0.475

        The area from $z = -2$ to $z=0$ will be approximately 0.475 (or 47.5% of the total area).

        -   *What does that tell you about the area from* $z = 0$ *to* $z=2$*?*

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area from $z = -2$ to $z = 0$ (or 47.5% of the total area).

            </details>

        </details>

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate below $z=-2$.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 2 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.95.

        ![](fig_approx_2stdev.png)

        The total area is 1, so the area in both tails combine will be 1-0.95 = 0.05.

        Since the distribution is symmetric, the area in the left tail will be half of that, 0.05/2 = 0.025.

        The area below $z = -2$ will be approximately 0.025 (or 2.5% of the total area).

        -   *What does that tell you about the area above* $z = 2$*?*

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area below $z = -2$ (or 2.5% of the total area).

            </details>

        </details>

-   [ ] **Problem:** 68-95-99.7 Rule Problem 3

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area from $z = -3$ to $z=0$.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 3 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.997.

        ![](fig_approx_3stdev.png)

        The distribution is symmetric so the area from $z=0$ to $z=3$ will be half of 0.997.

        0.997/2 = 0.4985

        The area from $z = -3$ to $z=0$ will be approximately 0.4985 (or 49.85% of the total area).

        -   *What does that tell you about the area from* $z = 0$ *to* $z=3$*?*

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area from $z = -3$ to $z = 0$ (or 49.85% of the total area).

            </details>

        </details>

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate below $z=-3$.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 3 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.997.

        ![](fig_approx_3stdev.png)

        The total area is 1, so the area in both tails combine will be 1-0.997 = 0.003.

        Since the distribution is symmetric, the area in the left tail will be half of that, 0.003/2 = 0.0015.

        The area below $z = -3$ will be approximately 0.0015 (or 0.15% of the total area).

        -   *What does that tell you about the area above* $z = 3$*?*

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area below $z = -3$ (or 0.15% of the total area).

-   [ ] **Problem:** 68-95-99.7 Rule Problem 4

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area less than $z = -2$. Remember to draw pictures as part of your solution.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 2 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.95.

        ![](fig_approx_2stdev.png)

        The remaining area is approximately 1-0.95 = 0.05.

        Since the normal distribution is symmetric the area in the left tail (the area less than $z = -2$) is half that, 0.05/2 = 0.025.

        The area less than $z = -2$ is approximately 0.025 (or 2.5% of the total area).

        </details>

        The remaining area is approximately 1-0.68 = 0.32.

        Since the distribution is symmetric the area in the left tail (the area less than $z = -1$) is half that, 0.32/2 = 0.16.

        The area less than $z = 1$ is the sum of the area to the left of $z = -1$ and the area between -1 and 1. We compute 0.16 + 0.68 = 0.84.

-   [ ] **Problem:** Stock Market

    You take a simple random sample of 200 adults from a town in the Western United States to determine the proportion of those in town who invest in the stock market. Assume the unknown population proportion or percentage of people in town who invest in the stock market is (or 30%). What is the probability that more than 25% of those in such a survey would have invested in the stock market?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.3$

    $n = 200$

    $\hat{p} = 0.25$

    $z = \frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \frac{0.25-0.3}{\sqrt{\frac{0.3(0.7)}{200}}} = -1.54303$

    **Normal Probability Applet Information**

    To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

    1.  Shade the side of interest.
    2.  Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
    3.  Read the probability from the area box. 

    ![](fig_StockMarket.png)

    $P(\hat{P} > 0.25) = P(Z > -1.543) = 0.9386$

    ``` excel
    =1-NORM.DIST(0.25,0.3,SQRT(0.3*(0.7)/200),TRUE)
    ```

    The probability that more than 38% of respondents in such a survey would have received a phishing email is 0.978.

-   [ ] **Problem:** Smoking Teens

    Calculate the probability, if possible. If it is not possible to compute the probability explain why not.

    A study was conducted to determine the proportion of American teenagers who smoke. Previous surveys showed that 15% percent of teenagers smoke. A Gallup survey interviewed a nationally representative sample of 785 teenagers. What is the probability less than 97 teenagers in the survey smoke?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.15$

    $n = 785$

    $np = 785(0.15) = 117.75 \geq 10$ (check!)

    $n(1-p) = 785(1-0.15) = 667.25 \geq 10$ (check!)

    $x = 97$

    $\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{97}{785} = 0.123567$

    $z = \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \frac{\frac{97}{785} - 0.15}{\sqrt{\frac{0.15(1-0.15)}{785}}} = -2.07409$

    ``` excel
    =((97/785) - 0.15)/SQRT(0.15*(1-0.15)/785)
    ```

    **Normal Probability Applet Information**

    To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

    1.  Shade the side of interest.
    2.  Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
    3.  Read the probability from the area box.

    ![](fig_SmokingTeens.png)

    $P(X < 97) = P(\hat{P} < 0.124) = P(Z < -2.074) = 0.0190$

    ``` excel
    =NORM.DIST(97/785, 0.15, SQRT(0.15*(1-0.15)/785), TRUE)
    ```

    The probability less than 97 teenagers in the survey smoke is 0.019.

-   [ ] **Problem:** COVID

    Calculate the probability, if possible. If it is not possible to compute the probability explain why not.

    Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that among the people in the United States who are fully vaccinated, the probability of getting COVID is very, very small: only 0.0001. Suppose you plan to survey 50,000 people ($n=50000$) who are fully vaccinated to see if they contracted COVID after getting the vaccine. What is the probability that less than 10 of the fully vaccinated people you survey contracted COVID after getting the vaccine?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.0001$

    $n = 50000$

    $np = 50000(0.0001) = 5 \ngeq 10$

    Since $np \neq 10$ we see $\hat{P}$ is not normally distributed. So we **cannot** calculate this probability!

## Sample Size

-   [ ] **Problem:** Generic Sampling Distribution Check

    Given the true proportion is $p = 0.1$. What is the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the requirements for the random variable $\hat{p}$ to be normally distributed?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.1$

    $\begin{align*}np &\geq 10 \\n(0.1) &\geq 10 \\n &\geq \frac{10}{0.1} = 100 \\n &\geq 100\end{align*}$

    $\begin{align*} n(1-p) &\geq 10 \\ n(0.9) &\geq 10 \\ n &\geq \frac{10}{0.9} = 11.\overline{1} \\ n &\geq 11.\overline{1} \end{align*}$

    Since both $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are greater than 10 when $n \geq 100$, we see that the smallest value of $n$ so that $\hat{P}$ is normally distributed is $n=100$.

## Sample Size

-   [ ] **Problem:** Doctors

    A survey of doctors is planned to see what percentage prescribe a certain medication. Find the sample size required to achieve a 5% margin of error if the confidence level is 90%.

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $z^* = 1.645$ (because we want a confidence level of 90%)

    $m = 0.05$

    $n = \left(\frac{z^*}{2m}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1.645}{2(0.05)}\right)^2 = 270.603$

    We need a sample size of at least 271. *Remember to round up to the next integer with sample size calculations.*

-   [ ] **Problem:** Dow Jones Industrial Average

    A recent book noted that only 20% of all investment managers outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average over a five-year period. Suppose you are in charge of designing the study. What sample size would be needed to construct a 98% confidence interval with a margin of error 3%.

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p^* = 0.2$

    $z^* = 2.326$ (because we want a confidence level of 98%)

    $m = 0.03$

    $n = \left( \frac{z^*}{m} \right)^2 p^*(1 - p^*) = \left(\frac{2.326}{0.03}\right)^2(0.02)(0.8) = 961.827$

    We need a sample size of at least 962. *Remember to round up to the next integer with sample size calculations.*
