This list of problems focus on computations and concepts that students have a tendency of mixing up or need additional practice. These problems are intended the to be used as interleaved retrievel practice at the beginning of class to keep the concepts fresh in students minds throughout the semester.

As the problems are selected the box can be checked and a note can indicate which week/day it was used. It is probably okay to use problems more than once as long as there is some time between uses.

    Given data that are right-skewed, $\mu = 5$, and $\sigma = 2$. What is the probability a random sample of 12 will have a mean greater than 10?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    We know $\overline{X}$ is not normally distributed since $n=12$ and the population is right-skewed. So we **cannot** calculate this probability!

## Sample Size Calculations

-   [ ] **Problem:** Blinks

    Suppose you are scientist and you want to use a confidence interval to estimate the true mean number of times a person in your city blinks each day. Find the sample size required to construct a 90% confidence interval with a margin of error 43 blinks for the true mean number of time a person blinks each day. Assume the standard deviation of blinks per day is 1240.

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $z^* = 1.645$ (because we want a confidence level of 90%)

    $m = 43$

    $\sigma = 1240$

    $n = \left(\frac{z^* \sigma}{m}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{(1.645)(1240)}{1240}\right)^2 = 2250.29$

    We need a sample size of at least 2251. *Remember to round up to the next integer with sample size calculations.*

## $Z$-Score Calculations

### Variable $\hat{P}$

-   [ ] **Problem:** Soccer

    John is a soccer player. He knows that he scores a goal 60% of the time. What is the $z$-score corresponding to John scoring 51 of 78 attempted goals?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.6$

    $x = 51$

    $n = 78$

    $\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{51}{78} = 0.653846$\
    $\begin{align*} z &= \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} \\ &= \frac{(51/78) - 0.6}{\sqrt{\frac{0.6(0.4)}{78}}} \\ &= 0.970725 \end{align*}$

    The $z$-score corresponding to John scoring 51 of 78 attempted goals is $z = 0.971$.

## Probability Calculations

### Variable $\hat{P}$

-   [ ] **Problem:** Phishing Emails

    First Data Corp. records indicate that in 2005, 43% of adult email users received a phishing email. A phishing email replicates an authentic site for the purpose of stealing personal information such as account numbers and passwords. Suppose a random sample of 400 adults will be surveyed on whether they have received phishing emails to determine recent trends. What is the probability that more than 38% of those in such a survey would have received a phishing email?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.43$

    $n = 400$

    $\hat{p} = 0.38$

    $z = \frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \frac{0.38-0.43}{\sqrt{\frac{0.43(1-0.43)}{400}}} = -2.01989$

    **Normal Probability Applet Information**

    To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

    1.  Shade the side of interest.
    2.  Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
    3.  Read the probability from the area box. 

    ![](fig_PhishingEmail.png)

    $P(\hat{P} > 0.38) = P(Z > -2.01989) = 0.9783$

    ``` excel
    =1-NORM.DIST(0.38,0.43,SQRT(0.43*(1-0.43)/400),TRUE)
    ```

    The probability that more than 38% of respondents in such a survey would have received a phishing email is 0.978.

-   [ ] **Problem:** Stock Market

    You take a simple random sample of 200 adults from a town in the Western United States to determine the proportion of those in town who invest in the stock market. Assume the unknown population proportion or percentage of people in town who invest in the stock market is (or 30%). What is the probability that more than 25% of those in such a survey would have invested in the stock market?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.3$

    $n = 200$

    $\hat{p} = 0.25$

    $z = \frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \frac{0.25-0.3}{\sqrt{\frac{0.3(0.7)}{200}}} = -1.54303$

    **Normal Probability Applet Information**

    To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

    1.  Shade the side of interest.
    2.  Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
    3.  Read the probability from the area box.

-   [ ] **Problem:** Smoking Teens

    Calculate the probability, if possible. If it is not possible to compute the probability explain why not.

    A study was conducted to determine the proportion of American teenagers who smoke. Previous surveys showed that 15% percent of teenagers smoke. A Gallup survey interviewed a nationally representative sample of 785 teenagers. What is the probability less than 97 teenagers in the survey smoke?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.15$

    $n = 785$

    $np = 785(0.15) = 117.75 \geq 10$ (check!)

    $n(1-p) = 785(1-0.15) = 667.25 \geq 10$ (check!)

    $x = 97$

    $\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{97}{785} = 0.123567$

    $z = \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} = \frac{\frac{97}{785} - 0.15}{\sqrt{\frac{0.15(1-0.15)}{785}}} = -2.07409$

    ``` excel
    =((97/785) - 0.15)/SQRT(0.15*(1-0.15)/785)
    ```

    **Normal Probability Applet Information**

    To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

    1.  Shade the side of interest.
    2.  Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
    3.  Read the probability from the area box.

    ![](fig_SmokingTeens.png)

    $P(X < 97) = P(\hat{P} < 0.124) = P(Z < -2.074) = 0.0190$

    ``` excel
    =NORM.DIST(97/785, 0.15, SQRT(0.15*(1-0.15)/785), TRUE)
    ```

    The probability less than 97 teenagers in the survey smoke is 0.019.

-   [ ] **Problem:** COVID

    Calculate the probability, if possible. If it is not possible to compute the probability explain why not.

    Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that among the people in the United States who are fully vaccinated, the probability of getting COVID is very, very small: only 0.0001. Suppose you plan to survey 50,000 people ($n=50000$) who are fully vaccinated to see if they contracted COVID after getting the vaccine. What is the probability that less than 10 of the fully vaccinated people you survey contracted COVID after getting the vaccine?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.0001$

    $n = 50000$

    $np = 50000(0.0001) = 5 \ngeq 10$

    Since $np \neq 10$ we see $\hat{P}$ is not normally distributed. So we **cannot** calculate this probability!

## Sample Size

-   [ ] **Problem:** Generic Sampling Distribution Check

    Given the true proportion is $p = 0.1$. What is the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the requirements for the random variable $\hat{p}$ to be normally distributed?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p = 0.1$

    $\begin{align*}np &\geq 10 \\n(0.1) &\geq 10 \\n &\geq \frac{10}{0.1} = 100 \\n &\geq 100\end{align*}$

    $\begin{align*} n(1-p) &\geq 10 \\ n(0.9) &\geq 10 \\ n &\geq \frac{10}{0.9} = 11.\overline{1} \\ n &\geq 11.\overline{1} \end{align*}$

    Since both $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are greater than 10 when $n \geq 100$, we see that the smallest value of $n$ so that $\hat{P}$ is normally distributed is $n=100$.

## Sample Size

-   [ ] **Problem:** Doctors

    A survey of doctors is planned to see what percentage prescribe a certain medication. Find the sample size required to achieve a 5% margin of error if the confidence level is 90%.

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $z^* = 1.645$ (because we want a confidence level of 90%)

    $m = 0.05$

    $n = \left(\frac{z^*}{2m}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1.645}{2(0.05)}\right)^2 = 270.603$

    We need a sample size of at least 271. *Remember to round up to the next integer with sample size calculations.*

-   [ ] **Problem:** Dow Jones Industrial Average

    A recent book noted that only 20% of all investment managers outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average over a five-year period. Suppose you are in charge of designing the study. What sample size would be needed to construct a 98% confidence interval with a margin of error 3%.

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $p^* = 0.2$

    $z^* = 2.326$ (because we want a confidence level of 98%)

    $m = 0.03$

    $n = \left( \frac{z^*}{m} \right)^2 p^*(1 - p^*) = \left(\frac{2.326}{0.03}\right)^2(0.02)(0.8) = 961.827$

    We need a sample size of at least 962. *Remember to round up to the next integer with sample size calculations.*
