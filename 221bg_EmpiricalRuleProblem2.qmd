---

-   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area from $z = -2$ to $z=0$.

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    The area within 2 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.95.

    The distribution is symmetric so the area from $z=0$ to $z=2$ will be half of 0.95.

    0.95/2 = 0.475

    The area from $z = -2$ to $z=0$ will be approximately 0.475 (or 47.5% of the total area).

    -   *What does that tell you about the area from* $z = 0$ *to* $z=2$*?*

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area from $z = -2$ to $z = 0$ (or 47.5% of the total area).

-   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate below $z=-2$.

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    The area within 2 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.95.

    The total area is 1, so the area in both tails combine will be 1-0.95 = 0.05.

    Since the distribution is symmetric, the area in the left tail will be half of that, 0.05/2 = 0.025.

    The area below $z = -2$ will be approximately 0.025 (or 2.5% of the total area).

    -   *What does that tell you about the area above* $z = 2$*?*

        Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area below $z = -2$ (or 2.5% of the total area).
