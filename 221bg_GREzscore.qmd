Scores on the quantitative portion of the GRE are approximately normal distributed with mean $\mu = 150.8$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 8.8$. Dianne earned a score of 155 on the quantitative portion of the GRE. What is the $z$-score corresponding to Dianne's score?

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

$\mu = 150.8$

$\sigma = 8.8$

$x = 155$

$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{155 - 150.8}{8.8} = 0.477273$

The $z$-score corresponding to Dianne's score of 155 is $z = 0.477$.
