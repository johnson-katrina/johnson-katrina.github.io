title: "Date Money (z-score)"
---

Assume that the amount of money BYU-Idaho students spend on a date is right-skewed with a mean of \$16 and a standard deviation of \$20. What is the $z$-score corresponding to a random sample of 45 BYU-Idaho students with a mean of \$10 spent on their last date?

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

$\mu = 16$

$\sigma = 20$

$n = 45$

$\overline{x} = 10$

$z = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{10-16}{\frac{20}{\sqrt{45}}} = -2.01246$

The $z$-score corresponding to a reandom sample of 45 BYU-Idaho students with a mean of \$10 spent on their last date is $z = -2.012$.
