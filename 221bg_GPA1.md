Suppose the mean GPA of BYU-Idaho students is 3.5 and the standard deviation is 0.7. It is well known that this distribution is left-skewed. What is the probability that a random sample of 70 students will have a mean GPA less than 3.6?

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

$\mu = 3.5$

$\sigma = 0.7$

$n = 70$

$\overline{x} = 3.6$

$z = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{3.6 - 3.5}{\frac{0.7}{\sqrt{70}}} = 1.19523$

Normal Probability Applet Information

To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

Shade the side of interest.

Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).

Read the probability from the area box.



$P(\overline{X} < 3.6) = P(Z<1.195) = 0.8840$

=NORM.DIST(3.6, 3.5, 0.7/SQRT(70), TRUE)

The probability a randomly selected sample of 70 students will have a mean GPA less than 3.6 is 0.884.
