| Blood Type | Probability |
|------------|-------------|
| O+         | 0.374       |
| O-         | 0.066       |
| A+         | 0.357       |
| A-         | 0.063       |
| B+         | 0.085       |
| B-         | 0.015       |
| AB+        | 0.034       |
| AB-        | 0.006       |

-   What is the probability that a randomly selected North American, will have blood type A?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    P( has type A+ ) + P( has type A- ) = 0.357 + 0.063 = 0.42

    The probability that randomly selected North American will have type A blood is 0.42.

-   What is the probability that a randomly selected North American, will '''not''' have O+ blood type?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    1 - P( has type 0+) = 1 - 0.374 = 0.626

    The probability that a randomly selected North American will not have O+ blood is 0.626.
