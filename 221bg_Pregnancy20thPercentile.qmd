title: "Pregnancy 20th Percentile"
---

The length of human pregnancies from conception to birth is normally distributed with mean 266 days and a standard deviation of 16 days. Find the 20th percentile.

<details>

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

$\mu = 266$

$\sigma = 16$

**Normal Probability Applet Information**

To find the $z$-score corresponding to the 20th percentile.

1.  Select all the area to the left.
2.  Type 0.2 in the Area box.
3.  Read the $z$-score from the left box.

![](fig_20th_percentile.png)

With 20% of the area to the left, the $z$-score is -0.842.

``` excel
=NORM.S.INV(0.2)
```

$z = -0.842$

$\begin{align*} x &= \mu + z\sigma \\ &= 266 + (-0.842)16 \\ &= 252.528\end{align*}$

The 20th percentile is 252.5 days ($x = 252.5$).
