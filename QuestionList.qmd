This list of problems focus on computations and concepts that students have a tendency of mixing up or need additional practice. These problems are intended the to be used as interleaved retrievel practice at the beginning of class to keep the concepts fresh in students minds throughout the semester.

As the problems are selected the box can be checked and a note can indicate which week/day it was used. It is probably okay to use problems more than once as long as there is some time between uses.

## Probability Rules

-   [ ] **Problem:** Probability Rules Error Identification

    What's wrong with the statement, "There is a 1.2 probability of snow in January in Rexburg"?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    A probability is a number between 0 and 1, $0 \leq p \leq 1$. The probability of snow cannot be 1.2 because $1.2 \nleq 1$ (rather 1.2 \> 1).

-   [ ] **Problem:** Snow in May

    Suppose the probability of snow in Rexburg in May is 0.79. What is the probability that there will be no snow in Rexburg in May?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    1-0.79 = 0.21

    The probability that there will be no snow in Rexburg in May is 0.21.

-   [ ] **Problem:** Tokens

    A box of tokens contains 8 blue tokens, 6 red tokens, and 4 yellow tokens.

    -   If a token is selected at random from the box, what is the probability that the token is blue?

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        P( token is blue ) = $\frac{8}{8+6+4} = \frac{8}{18} = \frac{4}{9} = 0.\overline{4}$

        </details>

    -   If a token is selected at random from the box, what is the probability that the token is not red?

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        P( token is red ) = $\frac{6}{18} = 0.\overline{3}$

        P( token is NOT red ) = $1 - 0.\overline{3} = 0.\overline{6}$

-   [ ] **Problem:** Blood Type

    The probability that a randomly chosen North American has a particular ABO blood type and Rh factor is given below.

    *Source: "The Analysis of Biological Data" by Whitlock and Schluter, 3rd Edition, page 125.*

    | Blood Type | Probability |
    |------------|-------------|
    | O+         | 0.374       |
    | O-         | 0.066       |
    | A+         | 0.357       |
    | A-         | 0.063       |
    | B+         | 0.085       |
    | B-         | 0.015       |
    | AB+        | 0.034       |
    | AB-        | 0.006       |

    -   What is the probability that a randomly selected North American, will have blood type A?

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        P( has type A+ ) + P( has type A- ) = 0.357 + 0.063 = 0.42

        The probability that randomly selected North American will have type A blood is 0.42.

        </details>

    -   What is the probability that a randomly selected North American, will '''not''' have O+ blood type?

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        1 - P( has type 0+) = 1 - 0.374 = 0.626

        The probability that a randomly selected North American will not have O+ blood is 0.626.

-   [ ] **Problem:** 3 Coin Flips

    If you flip a fair coin 3 times you could get either 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads with the following probabilities.

    | 0 Heads       | 1 Head | 2 Heads       | 3 Heads       |
    |---------------|--------|---------------|---------------|
    | $\frac{1}{8}$ | ??     | $\frac{3}{8}$ | $\frac{1}{8}$ |

    -   What is the probability that you will get 1 head in the three tosses?

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        P( 1 head ) = 1 - P( not 1 head) = 1 - (1/8 + 3/8 + 1/8) = 1 - 5/8 = 3/8

        </details>

    -   What is the probability you will not get (exactly) 2 heads in the three tosses?

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        1 - P( 2 heads ) = 1 - 3/8 = 5/8

# After Lesson 5

## Approximate Rule for Bell Shaped Distributions

Assign Problem 1-3 on the day of Lesson 5. I think the students should have enough information after the reading to help each other reason through these exercises.

-   [ ] **Problem:** 68-95-99.7 Rule Problem 1

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area from $z = -1$ to $z=0$. *Remember the normal distribution is symmetric.*

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 1 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.68.

        ![](fig_approx_1stdev.png)

        The distribution is symmetric so the area from $z=0$ to $z=1$ will be half of 0.68.

        0.68/2 = 0.34

        The area from $z = -1$ to $z=0$ will be approximately 0.34 (or 34% of the total area).

        -   *What does that tell you about the area from* $z = 0$ *to* $z=1$*?*

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area from $z = -1$ to $z = 0$ (or 34% of the total area).

            </details>

        </details>

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate below $z=-1$.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 1 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.68.

        ![](fig_approx_1stdev.png)

        The total area is 1, so the area in both tails combine will be 1-0.68 = 0.32.

        Since the distribution is symmetric, the area in the left tail will be half of that, 0.32/2 = 0.16.

        The area below $z = -1$ will be approximately 0.16 (or 16% of the total area).

        -   *What does that tell you about the area above* $z = 1$*?*

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area below $z = -1$ (or 16% of the total area).

            </details>

        </details>

-   [ ] **Problem:** 68-95-99.7 Rule Problem 2

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area from $z = -2$ to $z=0$.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 2 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.95.

        ![](fig_approx_2stdev.png)

        The distribution is symmetric so the area from $z=0$ to $z=2$ will be half of 0.95.

        0.95/2 = 0.475

        The area from $z = -2$ to $z=0$ will be approximately 0.475 (or 47.5% of the total area).

        -   *What does that tell you about the area from* $z = 0$ *to* $z=2$*?*

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area from $z = -2$ to $z = 0$ (or 47.5% of the total area).

            </details>

        </details>

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate below $z=-2$.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 2 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.95.

        ![](fig_approx_2stdev.png)

        The total area is 1, so the area in both tails combine will be 1-0.95 = 0.05.

        Since the distribution is symmetric, the area in the left tail will be half of that, 0.05/2 = 0.025.

        The area below $z = -2$ will be approximately 0.025 (or 2.5% of the total area).

        -   *What does that tell you about the area above* $z = 2$*?*

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area below $z = -2$ (or 2.5% of the total area).

            </details>

-   [ ] **Problem:** 68-95-99.7 Rule Problem 3

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area from $z = -3$ to $z=0$.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 3 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.997.

        ![](fig_approx_3stdev.png)

        The distribution is symmetric so the area from $z=0$ to $z=3$ will be half of 0.997.

        0.997/2 = 0.4985

        The area from $z = -3$ to $z=0$ will be approximately 0.4985 (or 49.85% of the total area).

        -   *What does that tell you about the area from* $z = 0$ *to* $z=3$*?*

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area from $z = -3$ to $z = 0$ (or 49.85% of the total area).

            </details>

        </details>

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate below $z=-3$.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 3 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.997.

        ![](fig_approx_3stdev.png)

        The total area is 1, so the area in both tails combine will be 1-0.997 = 0.003.

        Since the distribution is symmetric, the area in the left tail will be half of that, 0.003/2 = 0.0015.

        The area below $z = -3$ will be approximately 0.0015 (or 0.15% of the total area).

        -   *What does that tell you about the area above* $z = 3$*?*

            <details>

            <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

            Because the distribution is symmetric, it will be the same as the area below $z = -3$ (or 0.15% of the total area).

-   [ ] **Problem:** 68-95-99.7 Rule Problem 4

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area less than $z = -2$. Remember to draw pictures as part of your solution.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 2 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.95.

        ![](fig_approx_2stdev.png)

        The remaining area is approximately 1-0.95 = 0.05.

        Since the normal distribution is symmetric the area in the left tail (the area less than $z = -2$) is half that, 0.05/2 = 0.025.

        The area less than $z = -2$ is approximately 0.025 (or 2.5% of the total area).

        </details>

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area less than $z = 1$. Remember to draw pictures as part of your solution.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area within 1 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.68.

        ![](fig_approx_1stdev.png)

        The remaining area is approximately 1-0.68 = 0.32.

        Since the distribution is symmetric the area in the left tail (the area less than $z = -1$) is half that, 0.32/2 = 0.16.

        The area less than $z = 1$ is the sum of the area to the left of $z = -1$ and the area between -1 and 1. We compute 0.16 + 0.68 = 0.84.

        The area less than $z = 1$ is approximately 0.84 (or 84% of the total area).

        </details>

    -   Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area between $z = -2$ and $z = 1$. Remember to draw pictures as part of your solution.

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        The area we want to find is shown below.

        ![](fig_approx_neg2to1.png)

        If you subtract the area to the left of $z = -2$ from the area to the left of $z = 1$ you will be left with the area between $z = -2$ and $z = 1$.

        ![](fig_approx_neg2to1_equation.png)

        The area to the left of $z = -2$ is 0.025 (Recall the calculation $\frac{1 - 0.9 5}{2} = 0.025$ from "part a" above).

        The area to the left of $z = 1$ is 0.84 (Recall the calculation $\frac{1-0.68}{2} + 0.68 = 0.84$ from "part b" above).

        Taking away the area to the left of $z = -2$ from the area to the left of $z = 1$ we have $0.84 - 0.025 = 0.815$.

        The area between $z = -2$ and $z = 1$ is 0.815 (or 81.5% of the total area).

-   [ ] **Problem:** 68-95-99.7 Rule Problem 5

    Use the 68-95-99.7 rule to calculate the approximate area between $z = 2$ and $z = 3$. Remember to draw pictures.

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    The area we are interested in is shown below.

    ![](fig_approx_2to3.png)

    The area within 3 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.997.

    ![](fig_approx_3stdev.png)

    The area within 2 standard deviation of the mean is approximately 0.95.

    ![](fig_approx_2stdev.png)

    If we remove (subtract) the area between $z = -2$ and $z=2$ from the area between $z = -3$ and $z=3$, we will be left with the areas between $z=-3$ and $z=-2$ and between $z=2$ and $z=3$.

    ![](fig_approx_2to3_equation.png)

    0.997 - 0.95 = 0.047

    Because the distribution is symmetric these two remaining areas will be the same size.

    0.047/2 = 0.0235

    The area between $z = 2$ and $z = 3$ is 0.0235 (or 2.35% of the total area).

## Probability Calculations with Normal Distribution

-   [ ] **Problem:** Pregnancy

    The length of human pregnancies from conception to birth is normally distributed with mean 266 days and a standard deviation of 16 days.

    -   What is the probability a pregnancy lasts less than 242 days?

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        $\mu = 266$

        $\sigma = 16$

        $x = 242$

        $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{242 - 266}{16} = -1.5$

        **Normal Probability Applet Information**

        To find the probability corresponding to a z-score.

        1.  Shade the area(s) of interest.
        2.  Type the z-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
        3.  Read the probability from the area box.

        ![](fig_pregnancy_less242.png)

        $P(X < 242) = P(Z < -1.5) = 0.0668$

        ``` Excel
        =NORM.DIST(242,266,16,TRUE)
        ```

        The probability that a pregnancy lasts less than 242 days is 0.067.

    -   What is the probability a pregnancy lasts less than 278 days?

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        $\mu = 266$

        $\sigma = 16$

        $x = 278$

        $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{278 - 266}{16} = 0.75$

        **Normal Probability Applet Information**

        To find the probability corresponding to a z-score.

        1.  Shade the area(s) of interest.
        2.  Type the z-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
        3.  Read the probability from the area box.

        ![](fig_pregnancy_less278.png)

        ``` Excel
        =NORM.DIST(278,266,16,TRUE)
        ```

        $P(X < 278) = P(Z < 0.75) = 0.7734$

        The probability that a pregnancy lasts less than 278 days is 0.773.

    -   What is the probability a pregnancy lasts between 242 and 278 days?

        <details>

        <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

        We are looking for the area between $z = -1.5$ and $z = 0.75$, shown below.

        ![](fig_pregnancy_between242and278.png)

        We can find this area by taking away the area to the left of $z=-1.5$ from the area to the left of $0.75$.

        ![](fig_pregnancy_between242and278_equation.png)

        $P(242 < X < 278) = P(-1.5 < Z < 0.75) = 0.7734 - 0.0668 = 0.7066$

        ``` Excel
        =NORM.DIST(278,266,16,TRUE) - NORM.DIST(242,266,16,TRUE)
        ```

        The probability that a pregnancy lasts between 242 and 278 days is 0.707.

-   [ ] **Problem:** LSAT

    The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is required for admission to many law schools. The scores on the LSAT are approximately normal with mean of 150 and standard deviation of 9. Queen's School of Business in Kingston, Ontario requires a minimum LSAT score of 157 for admission. What is the probability that a randomly selected student will score below 157?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    \$\mu = 150 \$

    \$\sigma = 9 \$

    $x = 157$

    $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{157 - 150}{9} = 0.\overline{7}$

    **Normal Probability Applet Information**

    To find the probability corresponding to a z-score.

    1.  Shade the area(s) of interest.
    2.  Type the z-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
    3.  Read the probability from the area box.

    ![](fig_LSAT.png)

    ```         
    =NORM.DIST(157,150,9,TRUE)
    ```

    $P(X < 157) = P(Z < 0.\overline{7}) = 0.7817$

    The probability a randomly selected student will score below 157 is 0.782.
