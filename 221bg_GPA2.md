Calculate the probability, if possible. If it is not possible to compute the probability explain why not.

Suppose the mean GPA of BYU-Idaho students is 3.5 and the standard deviation is 0.7. It is well known that this distribution is left-skewed. What is the probability that a random sample of 17 students will have a mean GPA less than 3.2?

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

We know $\overline{X}$ is not normally distributed since $n=17$ and the population (of GPAs) is left-skewed. So we cannot calculate this probability!
