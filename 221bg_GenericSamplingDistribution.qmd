title: "Generic Sampling Distribution"
---

Calculate the probability, if possible. If it is not possible to compute the probability explain why not.

Given data that are right-skewed, $\mu = 5$, and $\sigma = 2$. What is the probability a random sample of 12 will have a mean greater than 10?

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

We know $\overline{X}$ is not normally distributed since $n=12$ and the population is right-skewed. So we **cannot** calculate this probability!
