title: "Pregnancy (Probability)"
---

The length of human pregnancies from conception to birth is normally distributed with mean 266 days and a standard deviation of 16 days.

-   What is the probability a pregnancy lasts less than 242 days?

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    $\mu = 266$

    $\sigma = 16$

    $x = 242$

    $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{242 - 266}{16} = -1.5$

    **Normal Probability Applet Information**

    To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

    1.  Shade the area(s) of interest.
    2.  Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
    3.  Read the probability from the area box.

    $P(X < 242) = P(Z < -1.5) = 0.0668$

    ``` excel
    =NORM.DIST(242,266,16,TRUE)
    ```

    The probability that a pregnancy lasts less than 242 days is 0.067.

-   What is the probability a pregnancy lasts less than 278 days?

    $\mu = 266$

    $\sigma = 16$

    $x = 278$

    $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{278 - 266}{16} = 0.75$

    **Normal Probability Applet Information**

    To find the probability corresponding to a $z$-score.

    1.  Shade the area(s) of interest.
    2.  Type the $z$-score in the box (negative value the left box and positive values the right box).
    3.  Read the probability from the area box.

    ![](fig_pregnancy_less278.png)

    ``` excel
    =NORM.DIST(278,266,16,TRUE)
    ```

    $P(X < 278) = P(Z < 0.75) = 0.7734$

    The probability that a pregnancy lasts less than 278 days is 0.773.

-   What is the probability a pregnancy lasts between 242 and 278 days?

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    We are looking for the area between $z = -1.5$ and $z = 0.75$, shown below.

    ![](fig_pregnancy_between242and278.png)

    We can find this area by taking away the area to the left of $z=-1.5$ from the area to the left of $0.75$.

    ![](fig_pregnancy_between242and278_equation.png)

    $P(242 < X < 278) = P(-1.5 < Z < 0.75) = 0.7734 - 0.0668 = 0.7066$

    ``` excel
    =NORM.DIST(278,266,16,TRUE) - NORM.DIST(242,266,16,TRUE)
    ```

    The probability that a pregnancy lasts between 242 and 278 days is 0.707.
