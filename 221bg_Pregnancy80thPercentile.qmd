---

The length of human pregnancies from conception to birth is normally distributed with mean 266 days and a standard deviation of 16 days. Find the 80th percentile.

<details>

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

$\mu =266$

$\sigma = 16$

**Normal Probability Applet Information**

To find the $z$-score corresponding to the 80th percentile.

1.  Select all the area to the left.

2.  Type 0.8 in the Area box.

3.  Read the $z$-score from the right box.

![](fig_80th_percentile.png)

With 80% of the area to the left, the $z$-score is 0.842.

$z = 0.842$

$\begin{aligned} x &= \mu + z\sigma \\ &= 266 + 0.842(16) \\ &= 279.472 \end{aligned}$

The 80th percentile is 279.5 days ($x = 279.5$).
