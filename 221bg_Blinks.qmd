title: "Blinks"
---

Suppose you are scientist and you want to use a confidence interval to estimate the true mean number of times a person in your city blinks each day. Find the sample size required to construct a 90% confidence interval with a margin of error 43 blinks for the true mean number of time a person blinks each day. Assume the standard deviation of blinks per day is 1240.

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

$z^* = 1.645$ (because we want a confidence level of 90%)

$m = 43$

$\sigma = 1240$

$n = \left(\frac{z^* \sigma}{m}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{(1.645)(1240)}{1240}\right)^2 = 2250.29$

We need a sample size of at least 2251. *Remember to round up to the next integer with sample size calculations.*
