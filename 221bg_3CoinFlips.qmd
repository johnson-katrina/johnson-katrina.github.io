If you flip a fair coin 3 times you could get either 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads with the following probabilities.

| 0 Heads       | 1 Head | 2 Heads       | 3 Heads       |
|---------------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| $\frac{1}{8}$ | ??     | $\frac{3}{8}$ | $\frac{1}{8}$ |

-   What is the probability that you will get 1 head in the three tosses?

    P( 1 head ) = 1 - P( not 1 head) = 1 - (1/8 + 3/8 + 1/8) = 1 - 5/8 = 3/8

    </details>

-   What is the probability you will not get (exactly) 2 heads in the three tosses?

    <details>

    <summary>Possible Solution</summary>

    1 - P( 2 heads ) = 1 - 3/8 = 5/8

    </details>
