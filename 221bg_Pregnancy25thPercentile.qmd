title: "Pregnancy 25th Percentile"
---

The length of human pregnancies from conception to birth is normally distributed with mean 266 days and a standard deviation of 16 days. Find the 25th percentile.

<details>

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

$\mu = 266$

$\sigma = 16$

**Normal Probability Applet Information**

To find the $z$-score corresponding to the 25th percentile.

1.  Select all the area to the left.
2.  Type 0.25 in the Area box.
3.  Read the $z$-score from the left box.

![](fig_25th_percentile.png)

With 25% of the area to the left, the $z$-score is -0.674.

$z = -0.674$

$\begin{align*} x &= \mu + z\sigma \\ &= 266 + (-0.674)16 \\ &= 255.216\end{align*}$

The 25th percentile is 255.2 days ($x = 255.2$).

The 1st quartile is 255.216 days.

``` excel
=NORM.INV(0.25,266,16)
```
