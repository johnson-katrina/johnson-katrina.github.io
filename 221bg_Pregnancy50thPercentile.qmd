title: "Pregnancy 50th Percentile"
---

The length of human pregnancies from conception to birth is normally distributed with mean 266 days and a standard deviation of 16 days. Find the 50th percentile.

<details>

<summary>Possible Solution</summary>

$\mu = 266$

$\sigma = 16$

**Normal Probability Applet Information**

To find the $z$-score corresponding to the 50th percentile.

1.  Select all the area to the left.
2.  Type 0.5 in the Area box.
3.  Read the $z$-score from either box (right box or left box, they are the same).

![](fig_50th_percentile.png)

With 50% of the area to the left, the $z$-score is 0.

``` excel
=NORM.S.INV(0.5)
```

$z = 0$

$\begin{align*} x &= \mu + z\sigma \\ &= 266 + (0)16 \\ &= 266\end{align*}$

The 50th percentile is 266 days ($x = 266$).

The median is 266 days.
